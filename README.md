# CamdenView
This is an augmented reality mobile application which allows the design of new buildings to be viewed from every angle while standing close to the development site. 
The project is part of Industry Exchange Network (IXN) with Camden Council.


The application development was done in Unity and built on iOS platform. 
The programming language used was C#. A 3D model of a new building was constructed in Blender and imported into Unity. 
A connection between the mobile app and Camden Council open database was established via an API.
A mobile application was created successfully. It could fetch data from the database, populate the data in a list, allow users to select the planning application they were interested in, display the detail of the selected planning application, and show the 3D image of the new building in AR view.
